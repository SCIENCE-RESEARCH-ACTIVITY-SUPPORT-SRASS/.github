## Hi there üëã

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of SRASS. This repository serves as the central hub for our open-source projects, documentation, and collaboration efforts.

### üçø What does SRASS do?
The formation of this group originally centered around the objective of creating a comprehensive system to facilitate scientific research activities for the Research Department at FPT University, Ho Chi Minh Campus. Nevertheless, we remain open to engaging in the development of additional projects as the need arises.
### ü§ù Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your contributions make a difference.
